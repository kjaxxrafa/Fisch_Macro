For you to use this macro install AutoHotKey.
After you have installed it, close AutoHotKey and open the file FischMacroV12.
When opened and ingame, u can click "P" so the macro starts. 
You can always stop the macro by pressing "O" and "M" to close the macro.

PS: this macro wasnt made by me just passing it on for people who can't be on their PC 24/7

Good Grind!
